#Roblox dashboard project

Hi guys, so this is a project that I think it would be cool to make. Basically, the idea is to make like a "web" structure with react force 2d graphs of your Roblox user and your friends as nodes. You can then expand the graph and find mutuals. I will be using React, Bootstrap, Javascript, Python (for backend), and probably AWS.

This is WIP, and it's also my first time using all of these tools for the purpose of fullstack web development!
